                      With the idea to bring the experience of science centers to school, I designed and developed a low cost dome based learning installation for Indian schools, ‘Kalpana’. It teaches students a geographic concept, “Sun changes its path in the sky with change in geodesic location and time of the year”. This concept is very difficult to understand with help of school text books. <br><br>

                      Students interact with physical setup to see sun’s trajectory visual with supporting audio response. A high fidelity prototype was developed and tested with students.<br><br>

                      Business Integration is a process of making systems communicate across standards. Mapping schemas is the most important requirement of the complete integration process. During user studies it was found that the  current workflow process of the mapping is linear with a lot of redundant tasks being performed by users due to lack of standards and platforms. Business users have all the knowledge but implementation is done by software developers. <br>

                      To enhance the workflow process a new method is proposed where business user can perform the mapping operations instead of just documenting. The application is designed such that it integrates in users current workflow and tools used by him. Hi-fidelity prototype was developed using Expressions Blend with retail, digital receipts as mapping content.<br><br>

                        The intention of the project was to design devices to handle rich information in futuristic interfaces for Air Space Management System. 3-D in 2-D display techniques for management of air traffic were studied with focus on Approach Control and the Tower Control. I implemented the prototypes developed using Augmented Reality to understand the relative positions of the aircraft and the usability issues. Seven interactive information visualizations concepts evolved out of which two concepts based on ‘Cheoptic Holograms’ and ‘Rubik Cube representation’ were detailed. ARTtoolkit was used to prototype the concepts. <br><br>

                        Tag-it is a cognition based interactive device designed for teenagers. The idea was to let teenagers enjoy randomness. Sun glass was taken as an artifact which can also be replaced by other daily products used by teenagers. The concept can be implemented using ‘Augmented Reality’ which will enable us to impose cognitive information on the real world. During this one week project, the idea was presented with Soft Prototype and Video.<br><br>

It promotes waste management.<br>The player has to compress the spring and tilt the phone to target the garbage to into dry, wet and aluminum garbage bin. Every time the target is successful a new leaf sprouts or else a worm is generated. The player wins if he could grow a tree and loses if worms take over the spring. <br><br><br>

                        Challenge in project was to create a visual identity of an object as a part of a family of 9 related characters with visual similarities. I took ‘Egyptian Onions’ as object and mapped its visual characteristics to ‘Devanagari letter forms’. I worked with stencils and represented the final product as a lamp installation. <br><br>

                        The challenge was to build two autonomous bots which will collect boxes kept randomly on a white grid and place them on predefined destinations in the shortest time. Together in a group of four we developed the bots to communicate wireless and perform the given task in the arena of the competition. <br><br>
