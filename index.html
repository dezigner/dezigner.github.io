        <p>Hi !<br>
                   I am Ishneet and this webpage tells a brief about me. I am a <b>User Experience designer</b>.</p>

<pre><code>               &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, I am working with &lt;b&gt;Insieve, a startup based out of bangalore&lt;/b&gt;. Here we are redefining information consumption patterns on web. We are building a smart browser that understands you, anticipates your information consumption habits and takes you to the useful information.

               &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Previously I have worked with &lt;b&gt;Microsoft, Clarice&lt;/b&gt;, ProArch and other startups. With masters in Interaction Design from &lt;b&gt;IDC, IIT Bombay&lt;/b&gt; and a background in Comp Science, I provide design consultation to startups.

               &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Also, my friends say, I belong to a &lt;b&gt;startup family&lt;/b&gt;. My brother in the front of league successfully runs a company called &lt;a href="www.cocubes.com"&gt;cocubes.com&lt;/a&gt;, my dad loves to teach &amp; he runs an institue called &lt;a href="www.gyanm.in"&gt;gyanm.in&lt;/a&gt;, and Atish, my husband is founder of company called &lt;a href="wwww.oobi.in"&gt; OoBI.in&lt;/a&gt; (I love the name btw). All of them are doing great work! Other than just work, my mum has super duper managerial skills and Bhakti, my beautiful bhabhi is a Business Analyst, loves to paint and is my encourangement to look beautiful :-) My family inspires me.

               &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than regualar work &lt;b&gt;I love trying new things&lt;/b&gt;. Nowadays, I am giving a shot at (new for me) recepies :-)
