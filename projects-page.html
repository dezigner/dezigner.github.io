                  With the idea to bring the experience of science centers to school, I designed and developed a low cost dome based learning installation for Indian schools, ‘Kalpana’. It teaches students a geographic concept, “Sun changes its path in the sky with change in geodesic location and time of the year”. This concept is very difficult to understand with help of school text books. <br>

                  Students interact with physical setup to see sun’s trajectory visual with supporting audio response. A high fidelity prototype was developed and tested with students.<br><br>

                  Business Integration is a process of making systems communicate across standards. Mapping schemas is the most important requirement of the complete integration process. During user studies it was found that the  current workflow process of the mapping is linear with a lot of redundant tasks being performed by users due to lack of standards and platforms. Business users have all the knowledge but implementation is done by software developers. <br>

                  To enhance the workflow process a new method is proposed where business user can perform the mapping operations instead of just documenting. The application is designed such that it integrates in users current workflow and tools used by him. Hi-fidelity prototype was developed using Expressions Blend with retail, digital receipts as mapping content.<br><br>

                  In past one year I seeded Splasche with a 3 member team.  We came along a productive path while positioning it from a collective knowledge sharing platform to a much useful decision making tool for marketers. Splasche understands the users business and then empowers them to explore themes created around their product and find the next story. <br>

                  Played a key role in defining product strategy and positioning. Responsible for complete design of product from user research to user interface design, data visualizations and collaborate with developers for implementation while sometimes working on html, ccs for fit finish.<br><br>

                  The aim of the INVISQUE project was to come up with new ways to perform and visulize search that would overcome problems identified during the UBiRD user study. Invisque provides infinite search space and investigates how design principles like “Focus+Context” and Gestalts pattern perception can be applied to create novel interactive visualizations. Evaluation of existing Resource Discovery system and user studies with researchers and practitioners was done to understand the requirements.<br><br>

                  A concept of future of mobile phone for the Indian context, a sharing device for the family was explored to bring in the feeling of being together (’fee’ + ‘be’) which the existing phone technology doesn’t seem to look into. This would ideally fit in conditions where children are staying away due educational or work reasons, but need a humanized portal to connect with their family.<br><br>

Sun glass was taken as an artifact which can also be replaced by other daily products used by teenagers. The concept can be implemented using ‘Augmented Reality’ which will enable us to impose cognitive information on the real world.
